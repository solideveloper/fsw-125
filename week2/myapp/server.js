 // I'm using a mac....  After npm install -g nodemon 
 // I was having permission issues as well as 'command not found' 
 // when trying to run 'nodeman server.js'. 
 // I added the script: 'dev": "npx nodemon server.js' in my package.json 
 // and I used npx nodeman server.js to run port 3000.  
 // I used both these commands after googling and not sure I understand which of the two worked. 
 // When I try to run nodemon server.js I continually get command not found.. 
 // I'm sure it has to do with permission. but i dont know how to get TO those permissions. 
 // -need help understanding.
